HOW TO INSTALL VELVETOPTIMISER
==============================



1. DOWNLOAD TARBALL
===================

Download the latest .tar.gz file from the website:

    http://bioinformatics.net.au/software.velvetoptimiser.shtml

For example:

    % curl -O VelvetOptimiser-2.2.4.tar.gz



2. INSTALL
==========

    % tar zxvf VelvetOptimiser-2.2.4.tar.gz
    % cd VelvetOptimiser-2.2.4
    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make
    % make install

Where VelvetOptimiser is installed depends on your Perl configuration. This is
typically in /usr/local/bin, but to check:

    % perl -V:sitebinexp

If the directory is not already in your path, you should add the following to
your .bashrc file:

    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin

You will have to log out and log back in for this to be incorporated.


3. TRY IT
=========

Type:

    % VelvetOptimiser

You should see the command line help. For detailed instructions read the
README file:

    % less README
